        <h2>In the Douro Valley, we visited a vineyard and took a boat ride along the Douro River. 
            The views from the boat were incredible. We saw the river winding its way through the valley 
            and the mountains rising up in the distance. The Douro Valley is a must-see if you ever go to 
            Portugal.
