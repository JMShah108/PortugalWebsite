        <h2>In Lisbon, we saw many ancient buildings and castles. One of the buildings we saw was the 
            Belém Tower, which is five centuries old. We also visited the Alfama district. 
            In this district, there were many narrow roads and red rooftops. My favorite castle was the 
            Jerónimos Monastery, which is almost 530 years old! Lastly, we visited the Padrão dos Descobrimentos.
            This monument was right next to the water, which was a great place to relax. Lisbon is a wonderful 
            place to visit, with beautiful architecture and delicious food.
