        <h1>Porto</h1>
        <h2>In Porto, we visited many shops and ancient buildings. 
            The São Francisco Church was one of the most beautiful churches we have visited. 
            The inside of the church was very bright and colorful. We also went to the Ribeira district. 
            This district had many shops and restaurants. You could even go on a gondola lift to get to the 
            other side! Another cool building was the Clerigos Tower. This tower is 249 feet high. 
            From the top of this tower, you could see the city. Porto is a very beautiful city. 
            Definitely put this city on your Portugal to-do list.
